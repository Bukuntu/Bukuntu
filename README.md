# Hi 👋, I'm Bukuntu 

**Bukuntu?** 🤔 Sounds like Ubuntu, right? 

Well ..a childhood's graphical fascination for **Ubuntu's** (Linux distro) colorful compact-disk jacket 💽 has now morphed into a full-fledged career where I safeguard systems 🔐 by leveraging **Ubuntu's** 💻 robustness and much more.

🔐 Dedicated to making the digital world safer for everyone.


## What I Do
🏗 Currently putting my shoulders to the wheels on challenging projects

🧠 Advancing skillsets in defense systems, incidence response, and compliance

📈 Take pride in staying up-to-date with the latest IT trends
